On Good Friday, Jesus died. On Easter Sunday, Jesus rose again. But on Saturday, we waited. Creation waited. Our God waited. Hope seemed dead, darkness the assassin. Call it a cave, call it the dark night of the soul – whatever label you give it, it is a painful time: waiting, hoping, and clinging with nothing but faith that the Light will shine again, that He will redeem our “Saturday”.

These were some of the things we discussed at this three-hour event on April 15, 2017, as we explored waiting in three areas: in our personal lives, in the foster care system, and as an oppressed people group waiting on justice. Presenters included Jessica Bhatti, Berisha Black, Chrystal Stewart, and Jenell Holt; worship leader was Krystle Sanchez. A portion of ticket proceeds was donated to [Foster Care Initiatives](http://www.fostercareinitiatives.org). Listen to the CAST #3: Waiting audio of the first-half presentations.
