Where are we as people, communities, the Church, and creation broken? What is keeping us from restoration? How can we transcend these obstacles to embrace and advocate wholeness through our Savior? These were some of the conversations and concepts we explored together at this three-hour event on October 15, 2016. Presenters included Renee Ronika, Kit Danley, Amy Jacober, and Alexus Rhone; worship leaders were Rachel O and Suzy Vulaca; and Kristen Miller provided an animation. A portion of ticket proceeds was donated to Neighborhood Ministries. Listen to the CAST #2: Restoration audio of the first-half presentations.
