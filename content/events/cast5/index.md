These are some of the conversations and concepts we’ll be exploring together at this three-hour inclusive event for justice-minded women who love Jesus. Join us as multiple presenters speak, sing, and perform on this theme in the first half, and then engage with us in immersive settings and conversations in the second half.

Tickets are available for $10 through Brown Paper Tickets, or $15 during the final two days of sale. (You can also sponsor tickets for under-resourced women who wish to attend – click on the envelope at the bottom of your screen to contact us for more info.)

A portion of ticket proceeds will be donated to Kairos Outside Phoenix.
