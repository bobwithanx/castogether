These were some of the conversations and concepts we explored together at this three-hour inclusive event for justice-minded women who love Jesus. Multiple presenters spoke and performed on this theme in the first half, and then engaged with us in immersive settings and conversations in the second half.

A portion of ticket proceeds was donated to [Kairos Outside Phoenix](http://www.kairosofaz.org/kairos-core-programs.html).
