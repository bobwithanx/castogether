      <title>CAST #1: Busyness</title>
      <link>http://www.castogether.com/events/cast1/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How does busyness hinder relationships? Who does being busy well? Why is it so pervasive? What can be done to leverage it for God’s purposes? When must we go against culture and label it an idol? These are some of the conversations and concepts we explored together at this two-hour event for women who want to come alive in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Where are we as people, communities, the Church, and creation broken? What is keeping us from restoration? How can we transcend these obstacles to embrace and advocate wholeness through our Savior?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CAST #3: Waiting</title>
      <link>http://www.castogether.com/events/cast3/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Good Friday, Jesus died. On Easter Sunday, Jesus rose again. But on Saturday, we waited. Creation waited. Our God waited. Hope seemed dead, darkness the assassin. Call it a cave, call it the dark night of the soul – whatever label you give it, it is a painful time: waiting, hoping, and clinging with nothing but faith that the Light will shine again, that He will redeem our “Saturday”.&lt;/p&gt;
